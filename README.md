# Minecraft-Modpack-Search
A Java App using CurseAPI to search for Minecraft modpacks with enhanced filtering and sorting. 

Right now, it's just a single, filthy Java file, but it filters modpacks by mod and last update date, and sorts them using popularity and last update time as weights. 

Some day, I may turn this into an App with a GUI.
